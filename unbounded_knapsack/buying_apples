Q==> Harish went to a supermarket to buy exactly ‘k’ kilograms apples for his ‘n’ friends.
The supermarket was really weird. The pricing of items was very different. He went to the
Apples section and enquired about the prices. The salesman gave him a card in which he found
that the prices of apples were not per kg. The apples were packed into covers, each containing
‘x’ kg of apples, x > 0 and ‘x’ is an integer. An ‘x’ kg packet would be valued at ‘y’ rupees.
So, the placard contained a table with an entry ‘y’ denoting the price of an ‘x’ kg packet.
If ‘y’ is -1 it means that the corresponding packet is not available. Now as apples are available
only in packets, he decides to buy atmost ‘n’ packets for his ‘n’ friends i.e he will not buy more
than n packets of apples.

Harish likes his friends a lot and so he does not want to disappoint his friends.
So now, he will tell you how many friends he has and you have to tell him the minimum
amount of money he has to spend for his friends.
